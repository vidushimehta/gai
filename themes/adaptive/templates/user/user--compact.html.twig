/**
 * TODO: Track https://drupal.org/node/2247677. This was added to rip the markup
 * out when displaying the user picture in nodes and commments, otherwise you get
 * crazy markup and even empty article tags etc.
 *
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to present user data included in the compact display mode.
 *
 * This template is mainly used when viewing a node or comment where the user picture
 * is set to display, we strip off the articl wrapper and any other items or markup.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - label: the users name set as a title. Adaptivetheme moves the h1 inside
 *   the article element for proper outlines.
 * - content: A list of content items. Use 'content' to print all content, or
 *   print a subset such as 'content.field_example'.
 * - Field variables: For each field instance attached to the user a
 *   corresponding variable is defined; e.g., account.field_example has a
 *   variable 'field_example' defined. When needing to access a field's raw
 *   values, developers/themers are strongly encouraged to use these
 *   variables. Otherwise they will have to explicitly specify the desired
 *   field language, e.g. account.field_example.en, thus overriding any
 *   language negotiation rule that was previously applied.
 * - title_attributes: HTML attributes set on the label wrapper markup.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the container element.
