Adaptivetheme for Drupal 8 was built with strick guiding principle that permeate
the entire design philosphy. Each decision is measured against one or more of
these principles before being committed.

The principles are simple:


1. Turn hours into minutes, minutes into seconds.

If we can do something faster, quicker, DRYer, do it. Do everything we can to reduce
development time.


2. Narrow the scope.

At every point ask - who is this for, how will it be used, what are the costs? At every point
favor reducing overheads and costs.


3. Favour the Site builder and Developer over all else.

Deliver usable features to the site builder, demand high level skills of the front end
developer.
