# Breakpoints Advanced
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Adaptivetheme ships with two breakpoint module groups - simple and advanced.
# The simple group is a subset of the advanced group and uses just two breakpoints,
# tablet-isolate and widescreen. Below is a list of all breakpoints included with
# AT Core (usable by all sub-themes in layout theme settings and here).
#
# SEE: adaptivetheme/at_core/at_core.breakpoints.yml
#
# These breakpoints use ems, which mean they are dependant on the base font size,
# so any pixel equivalents stated here assume base font size of 16px. Change them
# to suit your requirements.
#
#   mobile-isolate - 0 to 45em (0 to 720px), small screens only.
#   tablet-isolate - 45.063em and max-width 65em (721px to 960px), isolatate tablets.
#   wide-isolate   - 60.063em and max-width 120em (961px to 1920px), isolatate tablets.
#   wide           - 60.063em (961px) and up.
#   huge           - 120.063em (1921px) and up, for big resolution.
#
# Here you can see how each breakpoint cascades or isolates. Most of the time
# a layout will use tablet-isolate and widescreen OR tablet-isolate, widescreen-isolate
# and huge.
